## My process

- [x] Highlight and zone in on mvp for each component and over all

- [x] Scaffold project CSS

- [x] Outline layout of components

- [x] Outline CSS structure

- [x] Complete Order Summary component
  - [x] Complete Card component (resp)
    - [x] Complete button component

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Emotion Styled Components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) - For styles

### What I learned

This was a simple implementation that I did to see how fast I could spin up a component. In doing it I realized more where I slow down when it comes to frontend development, still mainly CSS (no surprise). Though I've gotten much better at separating when to use flex vs grid (imo) I think it could still use some work. I feel that work also needs to be done in how I set up components alongside each other.

_This section will be more detailed going forward_

### Continued development

- SVGs (manipulation, integration, creation)
- Emotion (Reusable components)
- React (Creating modular, reusable components)
- Wrapper Container Strategy

### Useful resources

- [Wrapper Container Strategy](https://ishadeed.com/article/styling-wrappers-css/) - Still havent fully gotten the hang of this but ill keep practicing.
